## üìù About The Project

There are many great Discord bots available right now, however, I couldn't find one that accomplished *everything* I wanted for free so I decided to solve my own problem. I wanted to make a centralized Discord bot that essentially replaces the numerous bots that I already use while also adding in some new features that I wanted specifically for my server. 


### Some Current Features
* Welcome Message
* Role Reaction
* Role on Live
* Moderation
* Music Player (YouTube & Spotify)
* Many more...

I'm fairly new at Javascript so the features are rolling in slowly but I have a lot planned and am actively adding onto this project.

### Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)


## üìì Usage

Currently, this bot is designed specifically for my use. That said, I am planning on adding a web-based command settings system in the near future to make it more accessible and dynamic.

Feel free to invite the bot to your server: [Click me to invite Ro!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=753334232864129104&permissions=8&scope=bot)
